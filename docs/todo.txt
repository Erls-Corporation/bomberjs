  routing
    make it so you can return the name of an app to use its router for the rest of the url
    in order to do that, we need to pass around the currently parse params

  bomber.js can take commands:
    startServer
    createApp
    repl
    startServer with node_debug

  responses
    set cookies
    set sessions

  HTTPStatusFactory objects
    5xx errors
    4xx errors
    3xx redirects

  logging, preferably something that matches the simpler parts of the log4j library
