  testing
    tests are run through a browser. Make requests: specify a url, request headers, method
      and say the status code you want back, any headers, and then you can run assertions
      against the result.  Can run them all or specific ones.

  routing
    make it so you can return the name of an app to use its router for the rest of the url
      in order to do that, we need to pass around the currently parse params
    make it so format is appended to the url with a . (if you want).
      And so that you can specify your default supported formats.

  bomber.js can take commands:
    startServer
    createApp
    repl
    startServer with node_debug

  responses
    set cookies
    set sessions

  HTTPStatusFactory objects
    5xx errors
    4xx errors
    3xx redirects

  logging, preferably something that matches the simpler parts of the log4j library
