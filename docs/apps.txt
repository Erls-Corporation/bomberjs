Apps are just a bunch of functionallity wrapped up into a
folder.  Bomber will look for the following files/folders
(all of them are optional):

config.js
  // Stores configuration for this ap
  apps: an array of apps to include
  
routes.js
  exports a router object (bomber/router.js)

views/<view-name>.js
  a view file exports functions (called actions to steal from Rails)
